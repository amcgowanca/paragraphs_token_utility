## Paragraphs Token Utility

A small utility module for enhancing the use of a Paragraph's parent entity's tokens. This small module was born from the need of attaching views via [Entity View Attachment (EVA)](https://www.drupal.org/project/eva) to a Paragraph while requiring to specify tokens as arguments of the paragraph and its parent entity.
